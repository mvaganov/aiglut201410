RTS + bullet hell + random maze

basic gameplay: select agents, move them around a maze, kill bad guys, win when all enemy nexi are killed

(2000) game is full of agents: energy point, user agent, nexus, enemy agent

(1999) each agent has HP, radius size, color
(1998) enemy and user agents have move speed, attack rate, bullet damage, attack cool down

(0805) particle effects

(1000) random map generation:
* generate dense graph in grid shape
* do random size adjustment to grid squares
* use depth-first-search (with random weight to next-neighbor) to identify maze paths
* create boxes as walls in blocked-off edges
(0800) energy points are randomly placed
	energy point is a circle with some particle effect animation
(0750) enemy nexuses are randomly placed
	inert energy points of a common enemy color that use particle effects when healing
(0850) enemy agents are randomly placed
(0851) user agents are placed in the same spot

(0900) select one agent with left click
(0890) give agents move orders with right click
(0400) select multiple agents (with rect tool like other RTS games, and operating systems)

(0205) user agents consume energy points they path over which give the player upgrade points
(0200) agents can be upgraded with upgrade points
(0199) when one agent is selected, they can be upgraded
(0200) agent upgrades:
	faster move
	faster attack rate
	more hp
	faster regen rate
	heal other agents

(0950) A: user-controlled agent
(0851) E: enemy agent
(0752) P: energy point
(0751) N: evil nexus
